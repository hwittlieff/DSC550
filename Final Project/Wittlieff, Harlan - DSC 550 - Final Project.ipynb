    "Many creative individuals dream of pitching their ideas for the next big television show to the major players at Netflix. These creators hope for the success of television series legends such as \"Law & Order,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Breaking Bad,\" \"The Office\", and the longest running show with thirty-three seasons, \"The Simpsons.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "However, before green lighting a new show, Netflix must evaluate key factors to attempt to predict whether the tv series will be a smash hit that their audiences will select for viewing out of Netflix's massive catalog. One of these factors that must be considered is the cost of production. When estimating the total costs of producing the television series, Netflix would likely require a solid prediction and understanding of for how many seasons the television series will run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the meticulous analysis of historical television series performance data, Netflix may be able to predict for how many seasons their latest venture is anticipated to run. To achieve this goal, I begin with the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset on Kaggle. The data must be cleaned and the movie data removed. This step will leave only data on television shows. A new column must be added to call out the number of seasons that the series ran. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is ready for analysis, numerous variables may be plotted to look for trends, correlation, and possibly establish causation. The trends in series runtime can be reviewed in a timeline looking back many years based on release year. Additionally, an average number of seasons by year may be calculated. The variable of TV ratings may also be investigated for a relation to the number of seasons. Finally, the data should also be reviewed for outliers through a box plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this analysis, I then plan to work towards determining whether the television series description can be linked to predicted series runtime in number of seasons. A regression model will be used from Netflix data to predict the total number of seasons."
